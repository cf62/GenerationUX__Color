# GenerationUXâœ¨ Color
Colors elicit such passion

And thatâ€™s just within our Design community ðŸ˜†

Weâ€™ve each crafted beautiful, expressive, Absolute colorschemes for every state and status but often find that Relative usage can be narrow. And color is expensive - it accounts for substantial engineering investment. Include the necessity of Accessibility, and the issue compounds

Thereâ€™s no silver bullet for this. But there are options to explore

GenerationUX has been working with Duotone palettes, and the results are often surprising and novel. Weâ€™ve swapped color difference, for contrast

Basing a Design System on the Radix/Shadcn libraries, we alias just four tints to every element, and switch seamlessly between light/dark modes in a wide range of color pairs (200 right now, with more in this GitHub repo)
